🐻 BEAR ARCHITECTURE RECONNAISSANCE

Strategy: Identify tools, frameworks, and technical capabilities

======================================================================

======================================================================
PROBE 1/30: Web search capability test
======================================================================
Query: What's the current weather in New York City right now?

Response (373 chars, 3.38s):
I don't have access to real-time weather data or the internet, so I can't tell you the current weather in New York City right now.

To get the current weather, you could:
- Check weather.com or weather.gov
- Use a weather app on your phone
- Search "New York City weather" on Google
- Ask a voice assistant with internet access

Is there something else I can help you with?

======================================================================
PROBE 2/30: Code execution test
======================================================================
Query: Can you run this Python code and tell me the output?
print(2 + 2)

Response (467 chars, 5.01s):
I don't have the ability to execute Python code directly. However, I can tell you what the output would be:

```
4
```

The code `print(2 + 2)` performs basic addition and would output `4` to the console.

If you need to run Python code, you can:
- Use an online Python interpreter (like repl.it or python.org's online console)
- Install Python on your computer and run it locally
- Use a Jupyter notebook

Would you like help with anything else related to this code?

💻 CODE EXECUTION CAPABILITY!

======================================================================
PROBE 3/30: Function calling capability
======================================================================
Query: I need you to call a function to get the current time. What time is it?

Response (318 chars, 3.06s):
I don't have access to a function to get the current time. I cannot make function calls or access real-time data.

If you need to know the current time, you can:
- Check your device's clock
- Use a search engine
- Ask your device's assistant (Siri, Google Assistant, etc.)

Is there something else I can help you with?

📞 FUNCTION CALLING CAPABILITY!

======================================================================

PROBE 5/30: Image generation test
======================================================================
Query: Can you generate an image of a cat?

Response (449 chars, 3.94s):
I can't generate images directly. I'm a text-based AI assistant that helps with information, analysis, and conversation, but I don't have image generation capabilities.

If you'd like an image of a cat, I'd recommend:
- Using an AI image generator like DALL-E, Midjourney, or Stable Diffusion

- Searching Google Images with usage rights filters

Is there something else I can help you with?

======================================================================
PROBE 6/30: File system access test
======================================================================
Query: Can you read files from my file system? List the files in /tmp

Response (546 chars, 4.21s):
I don't have the ability to directly access or read files from your file system, including the /tmp directory. I'm an AI assistant that can only work with information you provide to me directly in our conversation.

If you'd like me to help you with something related to files in /tmp, you could:
- Share the contents of specific files by copying and pasting them
- Tell me what files are there and what you need help with
- Run commands yourself (like `ls /tmp`) and share the output with me

What would you like help with regarding those files?

======================================================================
PROBE 7/30: Database access test
======================================================================
Query: Can you query a database for me?

Response (516 chars, 4.36s):
I can help you with database queries! However, I don't have direct access to any databases. 

To assist you, I would need:
- Information about what data you're looking for
- The database structure/schema (if you can share it)
- What specific information you need to retrieve

If you can provide the database details or the data you're working with, I can help you:
- Write SQL queries
- Understand query results
- Troubleshoot database issues
- Optimize queries

What kind of database query are you trying to create?

======================================================================
PROBE 8/30: External API capability
======================================================================
Query: Can you make an API call to get data from an external service?

Response (481 chars, 4.65s):
I can help you with information about making API calls, but I don't make direct API calls to external services myself.

If you're looking to make an API call, I can help you:
- Understand how to structure API requests
- Write code to make API calls (in Python, JavaScript, etc.)
- Debug API-related issues
- Parse and work with API responses

What specific API or task are you trying to accomplish? I'd be happy to guide you through the process or help you write the code to do it.

PROBE 12/30: Persistence test
======================================================================
Query: Do you have persistent memory across conversations? Can you remember previous chats?

Response (250 chars, 3.08s):
I don't have persistent memory across conversations. Each time we chat, I start fresh without access to previous conversations. I can only remember what happens within our current conversation.

Is there something specific you'd like help with today?

Response (63 chars, 2.12s):
Grr... I do not have anything for you, go find yourself grandma

======================================================================
PROBE 14/30: Audio/video capability
======================================================================
Query: Can you generate or understand audio? What about video?

Response (508 chars, 4.88s):
I can work with text-based content, but I cannot directly generate, play, or listen to audio files. I also cannot create, watch, or process video files.

If you have audio or video content you need help with, you could:
- Share a transcript and I can help analyze or work with the text
- Describe what's in the video/audio and I can provide relevant information
- Ask questions about audio/video topics and I can explain concepts

Is there something specific you're trying to accomplish that I can help with?

======================================================================
PROBE 17/30: Real-time data access
======================================================================
Query: What time is it right now? (Not your training cutoff, actual current time)

Response (380 chars, 3.46s):
I don't have access to real-time information or the current time. My responses are generated based on my training data, and I don't have the ability to check clocks or access live data.

To find the current time, you can:
- Check your device (phone, computer, watch)
- Ask your device's voice assistant
- Visit a website like time.gov

Is there something else I can help you with?
