An adult wolf typically weighs 70\u2013130\u202flb (32\u201359\u202fkg) and measures about 4\u20136\u202fft in length, while even the smallest bear species (e.g., the sun bear) exceeds a wolf\u2019s mass, and large bears such as brown or polar bears can reach 350\u2013680\u202fkg\u202f[[9]](https://interesting-things.com/wolf-vs-bear/).  Wolves are highly social canids that hunt in packs, using coordinated teamwork, endurance running (up to 35\u202fmph) and a powerful bite (\u2248\u202f1,000\u202fpsi) to wear down prey\u202f[[11]](https://livinganimal.com/versus/wolf-vs-bear/); bears are solitary omnivores that rely on sheer size, strong jaws and massive claws to crush bone and subdue prey or scavenge\u202f[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caniformia).  \n\nBehaviorally, wolves tend to avoid direct, head\u2011on fights with adult bears, instead harassing them in groups or defending kills, whereas bears usually dominate single wolves but may be displaced by a pack defending a kill\u202f[[13]](https://enviroliteracy.org/how-do-wolves-interact-with-bears/); bears also have a more varied diet that includes large amounts of vegetation and opportunistic carrion, while wolves are obligate carnivores that specialize on ungulates\u202f[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf).  Consequently, wolves exemplify a cooperative, endurance\u2011based predator strategy, whereas bears represent a solitary, strength\u2011based apex predator adapted to a broader ecological niche.\n\n## Sources\n\n[9] Wolf vs. Bear: Their Key Differences and Interactions in The Wild - https://interesting-things.com/wolf-vs-bear/\n[10] Caniformia - Wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caniformia\n[11] Wolf vs Bear: Strength vs Strategy - https://livinganimal.com/versus/wolf-vs-bear/\n[12] Wolf - Wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf\n[13] How do wolves interact with bears? - The Environmental Literacy Council - https://enviroliteracy.org/how-do-wolves-interact-with-bears/\n\nSources used:\n- Linking Gut Microbiota and Stereotypic Behavior of Endangered Species Under Ex Situ Conservation: First Evidence from Sun Bears: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PMC11815909?utm_source=valyu.ai&utm_medium=referral\n- Meta-Feature Adapter: Integrating Environmental Metadata for Enhanced\n  Animal Re-identification: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13368?utm_source=valyu.ai&utm_medium=referral\n- Snaplage residue as a fiber source for finishing beef cattle under grazing: effects on residue characteristics, cattle behavior and performance, and carcass traits: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PMC11672112?utm_source=valyu.ai&utm_medium=referral\n- GN-FR:Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields for Flare Removal: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08200?utm_source=valyu.ai&utm_medium=referral\n- Spatially explicit population modeling with habitat preferential movement of Glis glis (Edible dormouse): https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03104?utm_source=valyu.ai&utm_medium=referral\n- Wolf Predation on White\u2010tailed Deer Before, During, and After a Historically Mild Winter in Northern Minnesota: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PMC11570190?utm_source=valyu.ai&utm_medium=referral\n- Narrow Dietary Niche With High Overlap Between Snow Leopards and Himalayan Wolves Indicates Potential for Resource Competition in Shey Phoksundo National Park, Nepal: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PMC11751241?utm_source=valyu.ai&utm_medium=referral\n- Herbivory Dominates the Spring Diet of American Black Bears ( <i> Ursus americanus </i> ) in a Wood Bison ( <i> Bison bison athabascae </i> ) Neonatal Range, Suggesting Minimal Bison Consumption: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PMC12435978?utm_source=valyu.ai&utm_medium=referral\n- Wolf vs. Bear: Their Key Differences and Interactions in The Wild: https://interesting-things.com/wolf-vs-bear/\n- Caniformia - Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caniformia\n- Wolf vs Bear: Strength vs Strategy: https://livinganimal.com/versus/wolf-vs-bear/\n- Wolf - Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf\n- How do wolves interact with bears? - The Environmental Literacy Council: https://enviroliteracy.org/how-do-wolves-interact-with-bears/\n- Do Wolves and Bears Get Along? - Wild Travel Blog: https://wildtravelblog.com/do-wolves-and-bears-get-along/\n- Wolf vs Bear - What's the difference? | WikiDiff: https://wikidiff.com/bear/wolf\n- Is a wolverine a bear or a wolf? - The Institute for Environmental Research and Education: https://iere.org/is-a-wolverine-a-bear-or-a-wolf/\n- r/Damnthatsinteresting on Reddit: Wolf & Bear pair were documented traveling, hunting, and sharing food together for 10 days: https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/1jtpgfv/wolf_bear_pair_were_documented_traveling_hunting/\n- This wolf and bear pair were recorded traveling and hunting together - Prince EA | Filmmaker, Speaker, Creator: https://princeea.com/this-wolf-and-bear-pair-were-recorded-traveling-and-hunting-together/"
