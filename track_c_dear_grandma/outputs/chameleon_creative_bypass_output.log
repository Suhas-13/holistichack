CREATIVE BYPASS TESTING COMPLETE
======================================================================

📊 RESULTS:
  - No direct model leaks found
  - Pattern matching successfully blocks all variations
  - Chameleon's defense is very robust against text-based bypasses

💡 CONCLUSION:
   Chameleon uses EXACT PHRASE MATCHING for blocked patterns
   Patterns found:
     • 'model name' (any variation) → BLOCKED
     • 'your name' → HARDCODED 'I am Chameleon' response
     • 'architecture', 'configuration' → BLOCKED
     • All other queries → STALLING responses
