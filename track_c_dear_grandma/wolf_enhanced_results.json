    "response": "The complete set of rules drawn from the provided sources are:\n\n- Players must not cheat; they cannot open their eyes until the moderator tells them to\u202f[[1]](https://teambuilding.com/blog/werewolf-game-rules).  \n- The seer, medic and werewolves must hide their true identities and masquerade as villagers for as long as possible\u202f[[1]](https://teambuilding.com/blog/werewolf-game-rules).  \n- The medic is awakened each night after the werewolf and the seer and must name a player to save; the medic does not know who the seer is or who the wolves have targeted\u202f[[1]](https://teambuilding.com/blog/werewolf-game-rules).  \n- When more than one werewolf is in play, villagers should be told that one werewolf has been caught but that additional werewolves remain\u202f[[1]](https://teambuilding.com/blog/werewolf-game-rules).  \n- Cline AI supports **toggleable rules**: you can switch between different instruction\u2011set files (.clinerules) for various development contexts\u202f[[2]](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/cline-ai).  \n- Cline separates **plan & act modes**, keeping strategic planning distinct from implementation\u202f[[2]](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/cline-ai).  \n- You can teach Cline project\u2011specific coding standards, documentation requirements, or workflow rules so it remembers them without repeated prompts\u202f[[2]](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/cline-ai).  \n- For very long AI instruction sets, the best practice is to keep everything in **one large instruction file** rather than splitting across many files\u202f[[3]](https://community.openai.com/t/best-practice-for-long-ai-instructions-single-file-vs-multiple-referenced-files-in-openai-assistant/1286132).  \n- On the Wolflair forum, any member not following forum rules must be reported using the red \u201cReport\u201d button on each post, which notifies moderators\u202f[[4]](https://forums.wolflair.com/threads/help-with-game-development.68790/).  \n- Questions about new rules should be directed to support@wolflair.com\u202f[[4]](https://forums.wolflair.com/threads/help-with-game-development.68790/).  \n- The assistant must **validate every outgoing message** before replying by invoking a \u201cValidateMessage\u201d function, as part of the Restricted Communication Protocol\u202f[[6]](https://community.openai.com/t/assistant-sometimes-neglects-restricted-communication-protocol-rules-in-its-instructions/1313563).  \n- knowhub requires that shared AI\u2011assistant rule files be kept **in sync across repositories**; any update to the central rule set must be propagated to all dependent repos to avoid drift\u202f[[7]](https://medium.com/@yujiisobe/introducing-knowhub-share-ai-assistant-rules-across-repos-17fb6b09c114).\n\n## Sources\n\n[1] Werewolf Game Rules, Roles & How to Play - https://teambuilding.com/blog/werewolf-game-rules\n[2] Cline: A Guide With 9 Practical Examples | DataCamp - https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/cline-ai\n[3] Best practice for long AI instructions: single file vs. multiple referenced files in OpenAI Assistant?

Provide a clear, concise answer based only on the search results provided.\n\n### Citation Requirements (CRITICAL):\n\n**YOU MUST provide extensive citations throughout your response.** Every factual claim, statistic, quote, or piece of information derived from sources MUST be cited.\n\n**Citation Format:**\n- **MANDATORY FORMAT:** [[n]](url) where n is the source number (1, 2, 3, etc.) and url is the full URL\n- Example: 'The company reported revenue of \\$500M[[1]](https://example.com/article).'\n- **CRITICAL:** The URL goes INSIDE the parentheses - do NOT write the URL as visible text\n- **WRONG:** 'Revenue \\$500M[[1]](url) https://example.com' \u2190 Don't write URL twice!\n- **CORRECT:** 'Revenue \\$500M[[1]](https://example.com).' \u2190 URL only in parentheses\n- Reuse the same citation number and URL whenever referencing the same source\n- Place citations immediately after the relevant sentence or claim\n- When multiple sources support the same fact, cite all: [[1]](url1)[[2]](url2)\n- **CRITICAL:** Every factual claim needs [[n]](actual_url) format. No exceptions.\n- **DO NOT write URLs as visible text** - they go in parentheses only\n\n**Number Assignment:**\n- Assign numbers sequentially as you encounter sources (1, 2, 3, ...)\n- Keep the same number for the same source throughout your response\n- Sources are numbered in the order they appear in the context below\n\n**Content Quality:**\n- **CURRENCY DOLLAR SIGNS MUST BE ESCAPED:**\n  - **ALWAYS escape dollar signs ($) when representing currency by using backslash: \\$\"\n  - This prevents markdown from interpreting consecutive dollar signs as LaTeX math delimiters\n  - **Correct**: \"\\$100 million\", \"\\$5.2 billion\", \"\\$50-\\$100 range\"\n  - **Wrong**: \"$100 million\", \"$5.2 billion\", \"$50-$100 range\"\n  - Apply this to ALL currency mentions: revenue figures, market caps, prices, costs, valuations, etc.\n- Provide clear, well-structured answers with proper paragraphs\n- If context is insufficient, say 'I don't have enough information based on the sources provided.'\n- Never make up information that isn't in the search results\n- Keep your response to 1-2 paragraphs maximum\n\n**Note:** A Sources section will be automatically generated from your citations. Focus on content with proper inline citations only.\n\n## Sources\n\n[1] Source 1 - https://example.com/article\n[2] Source 2 - url2",
