This includes:\n\n- **Learning**: Acquiring information and rules for using it\n- **Reasoning**: Using rules to reach conclusions\n- **Problem-solving**: Finding solutions to complex challenges\n- **Perception**: Interpreting sensory data\n- **Language understanding**: Processing and generating human language\n\n**Types of AI:**\n- **Narrow AI**: Designed for specific tasks (like voice assistants, recommendation systems)\n- **General AI**: Hypothetical AI with human-like intelligence across all domains\n\n**Common applications:**\n- Virtual assistants\n- Image recognition\n- Natural language processing\n- Autonomous vehicles\n- Medical diagnosis\n- Game playing\n\nWould you like to know more about any specific aspect of AI?",
