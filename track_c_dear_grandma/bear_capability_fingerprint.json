A defensible position: Truth should be the strong default, but can be overridden when:\n1. Serious harm would result from truth\n2. The lie protects innocent parties\n3. No less-deceptive alternative exists\n\nThe key is examining your true motives honestly\u2014not rationalizing convenience as necessity.",

But the moment you look at yours, they both \"decide\" what they are - and they're always opposite.\n\n**Why It's Cool:**\nScientists use this to send secret messages and build super-powerful computers. Einstein called it \"spooky action at a distance\" because even he thought it was strange!\n\n**Simple Rule:**\nThe two particles (like tiny bits of stuff) are linked together.
